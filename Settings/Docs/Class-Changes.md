# Class changes

One section per class: the goal we agreed on, the ideas, and every change made. Belongs to section 9 (`K`) of the [Implementation list](Implementation-List.md).

## How to use

- **Goal:** one or two sentences on how the class should feel. Filled in when we discuss the class.
- **Ideas:** things to consider, not decided.
- **Changes:** one row per change, added when it is implemented and tested.

Status values: `idea`, `planned`, `done`, `dropped`.

Change table columns:

| Date | Skill | Before | After | Why | Status |
|------|-------|--------|-------|-----|--------|

### Bandit line (Rogue, Bandit, Chief Bandit, Shadower)

Under discussion since 2026-10-10. Ideas from other servers are in [Research-Other-Servers.md](Research-Other-Servers.md).

**Goal:** not set.

**How it plays now** (numbers from `SkillDetails.tsv`)

| Job | Main tools | What is wrong |
|-----|------------|---------------|
| Rogue (10) | Double Stab: 2 hits, 196% total at level 1, 280% at max | Fine |
| Bandit (30) | Savage Blow: 160% total at level 1, 480% at max. Haste, Steal, Dagger Booster | Savage Blow is worse than a maxed Double Stab until level 9 (288% against 280%). The first 8 points buy nothing. |
| Bandit (30) | Nothing hits more than one monster | No group attack at all until 3rd job, 40 levels later |
| Chief Bandit (70) | Band of Thieves (6 targets, 210% at max), Assaulter (450%, one target, stun), Meso Guard, Meso Explosion, Pickpocket, Chakra | Meso Explosion needs mesos on the ground, which is fiddly alone. Assaulter moves you but is slow. |
| Shadower (120) | Assassinate (3 hits of 600% from Dark Sight), Boomerang Step (2 hits of 500%, up to 4 targets), Shadow Shifter, Smokescreen, Venomous Stab | Assassinate needs Dark Sight first. Everything needs mastery books. |
| All | No Flash Jump. Assassins get it at 3rd job. | Slow to move around compared with the other thief |

**Ideas**

| Idea | Kind | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Flash Jump for the bandit line | New skill for the class | Robin's idea. The skill exists for Hermits (Flash Jump, 20 levels). Giving it to another job needs testing: the client may not let a Chief Bandit use a Hermit skill. |
| Savage Blow useful from level 1 | Rescale | Start at 6 hits and grow the damage, or raise the early damage, so the first point already beats Double Stab |
| A group attack in 2nd job | Rescale or new use | Let Savage Blow or Steal hit 2 to 3 monsters, or bring Band of Thieves forward |
| Assaulter as movement | Speed | Faster and longer dash, as players on other servers ask for |
| Dark Sight as a toggle | Quality of life | From MapleRoyals: press again to cancel, any attack leaves it |
| Assassinate without the Dark Sight setup | Simplify | From MapleRoyals: full damage without charging in Dark Sight |
| Steal's attack buff lasts longer | Small buff | From Classic World: 60 seconds instead of 30 |
| Meso Explosion without the chore | Rework | Pickpocket already drops mesos on hit; make the two work together smoothly, or let Meso Explosion drop its own |
| Boomerang Step usable on slopes and ledges | Fix | From MapleRoyals |

## Open questions

- Which classes are playable on our server? The server code has Evan skills; whether Evan works in a v83 client is not checked.
- Do skill changes need matching edits in the client's data? See `R-4`.
